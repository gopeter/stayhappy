        Never give up. Your brain is just tricking you. Even on the darkest
        days, there is something to look forward to. The new album of your
        favourite band. Snow. The birthday of a good friend. A few days off when
        the kids are with grandma and grandpa. Eggnog at Christmas.
      </p>
      <p>You get the idea. Your brain forgets all the good stuff, though.</p>
      <h3>How does it work</h3>
      <p>
        So let yourself remember those good things. It doesn't matter if it's
        tomorrow or a few months from now. There's so much to look forward to.
        StayHappy was built to help you focus on these things. We distinguish
        between three categories.

        All the things, no matter small or big, you're grateful for each day.
        Your child's cold feet when they crawl under your covers in the morning.
        The coffee from your portafilter. The scent of your favorite perfume
        that will always remind you of that one vacation.

        Some things that have happened in your life that always bring a smile to
        your face. Your wedding. The day you purchased your motor cycle. Your
        graduation.

        The next BBQ at your best friend's house. The upcoming ski vacation. The
        PlayStation game you've been waiting for for months.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever you need a smile, just look up what you've experienced and
        achieved in your life. And what's coming next, because, you know, there
        is always something to look forward to.
      </p>
      <h3>When will it be ready?</h3>
      <p>
        StayHappy is an iOS app and currently{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/gopeter/stayhappy-app">
          under active development
        </a>
        . While you have to feed it with data in the app, it's main purpose is a
        widget on your smartphone, which should always remind you of the
        beautiful sides of your life.
        <br />
        It shows you the next things to look forward to. And if there is
        currently nothing, then you will simply be shown the things that please
        you every day â€“ or that have pleased you in the past.
      </p>
      <h3>What's about the pricing?</h3>
      <p>
        Our app will always be free (as long as we can host it for free) and
        open source. You can also self-host it on your own servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that StayHappy is built by a few people who are affected
        themselves and who could draw some good from this approach. To say it
        short and clear: this thing has no medical or therapeutic background!
      </p>
