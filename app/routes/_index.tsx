        <strong>Never give up. Your brain is just tricking you.</strong> Even on
        the darkest days, there is something to look forward to. The new album
        of your favourite band. Snow. The birthday of a good friend. A few days
        off when the kids are with grandma and grandpa. Eggnog at Christmas.
        <br />
        You get the idea.
      </p>
      <p>Your brain forgets all the good stuff, though.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>So let yourself remember those good things.</strong> It doesn't
        matter if it's tomorrow or a few months from now. There's so much to
        look forward to. StayHappy was built to help you focus on these things.
        We distinguish between the following three areas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Gratefulness:</strong> all the things, no matter small or big,
          you're grateful for each day. Your child's cold feet when they crawl
          under your covers in the morning. The coffee from your portafilter.
          The scent of your favorite perfume that will always remind you of that
          one vacation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Memories:</strong> some things that have happened in your life
          that always bring a smile to your face. Your wedding. The day you
          purchased your motor cycle. Your graduation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Events:</strong> the next BBQ at your best friend's house. The
          upcoming ski vacation. The PlayStation game you've been waiting for
          for months.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whenever you need a smile, just look up what you've experienced and
        achieved in your life. And what's coming next, because, you know, there
        is <strong>always</strong> something to look forward to.
      </p>
      <p>
        StayHappy is currently under active development. While you can use it in
        the browser as any other web-app, it's main purpose is a widget on your
        smartphone, which should always remind you of the beautiful sides of
        your life.
        <br />
        It always shows you the next things to look forward to. And if there is
        currently nothing, then you will simply be shown the things that please
        you every day â€“ or that have pleased you in the past.
        <br />

        open source. You can also self-host it on your own servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that StayHappy is built by a few people who are affected
        themselves and who could draw some good from this approach. To say it
        short and clear: this thing has no medical or therapeutic background!
