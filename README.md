# Fuck depression

Never give up. Your brain is just fucking with you. Even on the darkest days, there is something to look forward to. The new album of your favorite band. Snow. The birthday of a good friend. A few days off when the kids are with grandma and grandpa. Eggnog at Christmas. You get the idea.

## Status

Built on top of Remix, Prisma and Postgres, deployed to Vercel. [stayhappy.app](https://stayhappy.app) will always be open source and free (as long as I can host it for free). Host your own version or you use the hosted one on [stayhappy.app](https://stayhappy.app). For now, I'm not sure how to handle terms of use, data protection clauses and so on. Any help would be appreciated!

## Development

The app is based on the Remix template [`remix-prisma-starter`](https://github.com/jfranciscosousa/remix-prisma-starter). Please check the repository for all details.

### Quickstart

- Make sure to have Postgresql installed
- `cp .env.sample .env` and enter the right database credentials
- Run migrations with `npx prisma migrate dev`
- Start with `npm run dev`

### Run your own

To run StayHappy by your own I recommed to use Vercel.

- Clone this repository
- Create a project on Vercel and link it to the cloned project
- Create a postgres database on Vercel (env var must start with `DATABASE`, not Vercel's default `POSTGRES`)
- Enable the signup function again (remove the `disabled` attribute on the sign up form button and remove the early return in the `createUser` function)
- Create a user, go to the profile page and copy the JWT
- Download [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app/) to your iPhone, add a new script and paste the content from `./scriptable/happy.js` into it. Add a text input under "Share Sheet Inputs" in the script's settings
- Add the widget to your homescreen, choose the script you've just created and paste the JWT as parameter
- Stay happy! ðŸ¥³

### Testing

This template repo has `playwright` setup with `react-testing-library` utilities. You can see some example tests on the repo itself.

It loads up `.env.test` file config, so it uses a different database and a different dev server port for the E2E tests.

All tests are run in sync by a single worker so we can safely reset the database before each test starts.

Before running `npm run dev test` for the first time, make sure to run these commands:
- `npx playwright install`
- `npx playwright install-deps`
