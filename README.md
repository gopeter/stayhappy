# Fuck depression

Never give up. Your brain is just fucking with you. Even on the darkest days, there is something to look forward to. The new album of your favorite band. Snow. The birthday of a good friend. A few days off when the kids are with grandma and grandpa. Eggnog at Christmas. You get the idea.

This repository just holds some static content for [stayhappy.app](https://stayhappy.app). It was planned as a web app, but I decided to build a native iOS app and abandonned the web version. That's why I removed all of the logic stuff (it was built as a Remix app with a Postgres backend) and just leaved the static content.
